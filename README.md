## Introduction

This is a Front-End Challenge created by Picatic inc. The app is providing the following functionality:
  * Simple Login page support where user need to enter API key to access Picatic Developer APIs
  * Show a list of events for a given user, fetched from our API
  * Selecting an event replaces the content screen with a list of ticket_prices from that event
  * Clicking Edit button on a Ticket row will allow you to edit the fields inline
  * Clicking Save while in edit mode patches the updated ticket information
  * Clicking on the user button in right top corner will logout user and delete cookie
This app was developed using Angular Js Framework, and Angular Material UI Component Framework. Also I used Material Design Data Table (url: https://github.com/daniel-nagy/md-data-table) and Angular JS Cookies.
